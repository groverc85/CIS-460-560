There was an error in my initialization list saying ”parenthesized initialization of a member array is a gnu extension“, so I googled it and browsed through http://blog.smartbear.com/c-plus-plus/the-biggest-changes-in-c11-and-why-you-should-care/ and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29743745/c-member-array-initalisation-without-default-constructors. I finally got rid of the parentheses and replaced them with {}.

Error message saying setw is not defined, got my help from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18983745/error-message-setw-is-not-defined-using-g, it turned out you’ll need to add #include <iomanip> line of code.
